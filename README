Cloud Foundry is an open platform-as-a-service (PaaS). The system supports
multiple frameworks, multiple application infrastructure services and
deployment to multiple clouds.

== What is this component

The vcap-ruby repo contains the auto-reconfiguration and cfruntime modules.  cf-runtime is a client library that makes it easier to connect to Cloud Foundry services from your Ruby applications.  The auto-reconfiguration module is used internally by the Cloud Foundry staging plugins to automatically connect Ruby and Sinatra applications to Cloud Foundry services.
